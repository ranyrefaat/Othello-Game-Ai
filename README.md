- Human Vs Ai Mode. ðŸ§‘ðŸ¤–
- Ai Vs Ai Mode. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
## Algorithm Used
- Level 1: Plays Randomly From Set of All Available Moves.
- Level 2-7: Uses MiniMax Algorithm With Alpha Beta Pruning.
## Heuristics For Evaluation
- Coin Parity.
- Mobility.
- Corners Captured.
- Stability.

All of these Heuristics were taken from [this paper](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse573/04au/Project/mini1/RUSSIA/Final_Paper.pdf).
